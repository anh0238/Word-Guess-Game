# Word-Guess-Game
Project Objective:
This game is modeled after a game of hangman. The computer will choose at random a word from the themed array using Javasript and then the User will guess random letters on their keyboard to reveal the word. 

Creating this game is useful, as it illustrates my ability to work with HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build a styled and functional game. 

How to play:
The game will start when the user presses any button on their keyboard and continues until the user has either guessed the word successfully or run out of attemps. 

This project was built and is maintained by Alex Henderson. Please contact me with any questions!
